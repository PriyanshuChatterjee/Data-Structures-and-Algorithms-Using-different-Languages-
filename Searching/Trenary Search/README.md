## Ternary Search Algorithm

It is generally based on divide and conquer algorithm. This algorithm is used to find an element in an array.

### Points to remember:-

1. The given array must be in sorted order. If it is not sorted, make the array sorted.
2. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1).
3. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log3(n)), where n is the size of the array.
